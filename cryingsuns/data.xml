  <history>
    <header>The Plot</header>
    <text>
	After 700 years of peace and prosperity, the Galactic Empire has suddenly been shattered into pieces.

  The OMNIs, god-like machines which did everything for their human masters, have mysteriously shut down. And humankind, having long since lost the ability to survive on its own, is dangerously close to extinction.

  But somewhere in a far corner of the Galaxy is Gehenna, a planet of ice and rock and a top-secret facility that is the pinnacle of Imperial Tech and also humanity‚Äôs last chance.

  You are a clone of Admiral Ellys Idaho, a weapon fashioned from flesh, the best Imperial Admiral ever to battle in the stars and you have just been awoken on this planet by its strange and darkly-humorous Guardian, Kaliban, the last functional OMNI to exist.  

  Your mission: skillfully command a battleship through the Empire's now chaotic, violent clusters ‚Äì‚Äìwhere one wrong move could be your last‚Äì‚Äì as you try to reactivate the OMNIs and save the future of all humankind.

  But you must leave Gehenna now.... for time has almost run out.

      <description>Crying Suns inclusion of a well integrated story in a rogue-lite game marks it out as something of an oddity in the genre. Good design and battles that offer just enough tactical depth that even beginners can enjoy themselves.</description>

      <description>It is one of those titles I would fully recommend to any strategy fan with sci-fi tastes. It came out of nowhere, flying under my radar and sneakily placing itself in my 2019‚Äôs top 10 list.</description>

      <description>Crying Suns does right by its predecessors, all while carving out its own space in the genre. The sci-fi tactics game tosses you into the unknown with a need to find answers and a battleship to blast away the opposition. With solid mechanics and a superb story, it‚Äôs a good time waiting to be had.</description>
